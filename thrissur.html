            <p class="card-text">On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala.

                The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India

            <p class="card-text">A University of Art and Culture, Kerala Kalamandir is a Government of India recognized institution dedicated to providing learning in the many performing arts native to India. Their main focus has always been on the arts that have been developed in Southern India.

                The Kerala Kalamandalam was what gave three main arts of Kerala a new life, namely Kathakali, Kudiyattam, and Mohiniyattam. For the sake of performing arts, and if you are someone who is a fanatic for them, this is definitely the place to be. The best part is that the institute is housed on the banks of the Bharathapuzha River.
